# Special Notes for reproducing the results

1. The default training setting for the three models is training with the full training set, you can check the log generated to get the results of low-resource settings
2. For Sudowoodo, the training should be done in three passes, you can first run the [lakehopper-on-sudo-p2v.py](./lakehopper-on-sudo-p2v.py) and [lakehopper-on-sudo-v2s.py](lakehopper-on-sudo-v2s.py), use the [run-sudowoodo-full-lakehopper.py](./sudo/run-sudowoodo-full-lakehopper.py) and [run-sudowoodo-full-semtab-lakehopper.py](./sudo/run-sudowoodo-full-semtab-lakehopper.py) respectively to get the contrastive learning step of Sudowoodo inside folder [sudo](./sudo), then you can follow the instruction in [lakehopper-on-sudo-p2v.py](./lakehopper-on-sudo-p2v.py) and [lakehopper-on-sudo-v2s.py](lakehopper-on-sudo-v2s.py) to uncomment the lines to proceed.
3. For RECA, please download the required files first in folder [RECA](https://github.com/ysunbp/LakeHopper/tree/main/data/RECA), and then download the pre-trained checkpoint on the PublicBI at [checkpoints](https://github.com/ysunbp/LakeHopper/tree/main/checkpoints). The training on PublicBI to VizNet is direct, if you do not need to retrain the model on the PublicBI dataset, otherwise, please run [train-publicbi.py](./reca/train-publicbi.py); the training on VizNet to Semtab2019 can be done by directly running [lakehopper-on-reca-v2s.py](./lakehopper-on-reca-v2s.py).
